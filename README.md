#RoboCrack
>A script that ckecks whether your password is weak or not. It was inspired by the password cracker used by Elliot Alderson in the Mr.Robot tv-series.
##Usage
```$ python robot.py```
##TODOs:
* Will try to make it more efficient and test more permutations.

##Example
```
$ python robot.py 
username:karan_desai
password:kd2811desai

Enter as much information as possible(as much as a good social engineer might be able to gather).Enter 'end' when done.

For example: Nickname, Birthdate etc.
karan desai
